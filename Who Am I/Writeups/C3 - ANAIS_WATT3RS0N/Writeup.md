From its format, we suspected it might be encoded in one of the Base encoding types, so we used CyberChef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode it:

That's when we discovered that Tina, the fearsome bully of Elmore Junior High, had taken Anais's doll. But did you know Tina did it because she couldn't sleep at night? Now you know both the flag and the reason behind her actions.
