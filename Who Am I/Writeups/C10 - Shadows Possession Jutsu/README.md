**C10: Shadows Possession Jutsu**

*A hidden threat lurks in the network, moving like a shadow possession jutsu, silently altering systems. The attacker’s strategy mirrors Shikamaru’s genius—calculated, precise, and hard to trace. As a shinobi investigator, your mission is to uncover the faint trails left behind, crack the coded mysteries like deciphering enemy jutsu, and stop the threat before it spreads like the Akatsuki’s influence. The fate of the network depends on your ability to outwit this unseen adversary—will you illuminate the shadows, or fall prey to their cunning?*
